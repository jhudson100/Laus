The Quaxiculo Font
===================

Remember the old dot-matrix printers? The really old ones with nine-pin printheads?
Ever get nostalgic for that appearance? Then this is the font for you!
Each character is rendered in a matrix that's nine dots high (five for
the x-height, two for ascenders, and two for descenders). Some printers
could perform horizontal dot positioning with half-dot precision; that's
what this font simulates.

Note that there is no kerning or other space adjustments. This is intentional;
the goal was to simulate as closely as feasible the output of 1980's
and 1990's era dot matrix printers. Output was usually monospaced
(although some printers did proportional text).
